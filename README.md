# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-with-Llama-2-and-LangChain
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines a retriever and a generative language model to deliver accurate response. It involves retrieving relevant information from a large corpus and then generating contextually appropriate responses to queries. Here we use the quantized version of the Llama 2 13B LLM with LangChain to perform generative QA with RAG. The notebook file has been tested in Google Colab with T4 GPU.
